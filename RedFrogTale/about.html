<h1>Red Frog tale</h1>
</br>
<p>
Some frogs can change their color, chameleon-like, according to light, temperature, humidity, or even mood. Fear or excitement makes many frogs and toads turn pale, but others, 
darken when disturbed.Some frog is normally green, but turns white in the heat of the day to reflect heat and keep cool.

<p>
Climate change would change the nature environment for every species. If temperature rises too much, it causes 
a chaos in all our ecosystems. Frogs, fish, reefs could die and many more <a href="https://onekindplanet.org/top-10/10-adorable-animals-threatened-by-climate-change/">species</a> have difficulties to adapt.
 Therefore it is good to think forward and support climate activism already from very early age. 
</p>
<p>In this tale a red frog calls the demonstration to stop the cuttin of the wood and burning trees. Through the short story,
kids get to know the colors of the nature and species diversity.
