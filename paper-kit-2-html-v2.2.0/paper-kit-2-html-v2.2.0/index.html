                    Trolltunga (together with Prekestoilen) is the most famous rock formation in Norway. I was in Trolltunga 3 times in different weather conditions with different people. </br> Once it was early spring in April where all the water melted but still remaining heap of snow.
                    It was one guy from Indonesia with us, and it was his first time to stand on the snow and touch it. That time we slept in Hardangervidda camping and we visisted also Folgefonna.
                    The second time friend droe from Bergen in October. It was grey, bit rainy and misty. But we could still see ca. 20 meters around.  </br>
                    The third time, it was in late June in perfect sunny weather. We have seen some proposols on the rock. And also we have seen some like 2 people disguised as a donkey.
                    One in front one in back inside one costume climbing up to Trolltunga. We met also some trolls. My friend picked garbage on the way to make something enviromentalistic and so to safe the nature. </br>
                    One should reserve a whole day for this trip, it takes about 8 hour just go to come to the Trolltunga from Skjeggedal. First 2 hours is it steep, and then it is more like "vidda" it means plane.
                    Some people are camping in this national park.

                    I was in Stavanger and nearby 3 times during my stay in Norway.
                    In Stavanger there is a central lake, and colourful wooden houses with typical Vestland architecture. There are alo beaches there with swans and also rocks with the prehistoric rock-carvings (2,000 - 3,000 years ago)
                    in Austre Åmøy. It is worth to visit place called Swords in rock, especially at dusk as you can make beautiful photos.  </br>

                    Near Stavanger, there are lot of nice places to visit. I took it as a "must see", while I am in Norway. Most visited places in Rogaland are Prekestoilen and Kjerag, which are both interesting rock formation aboe the Lysefjord.
                    Prekestoilen starting in Tau and you can take a boat from Stavanger to get there. Or you can go sail on Lysefjord and see  Prekestoilen from the boat as well as wonderful waterfalls falling down from cliffs.   </br>
                    While Prekestoilen is about 30 min from Stavanger by boat, Kjerag is more than 1 hour by bus.

                    I was in the north to see Aurora. Vestrålen. It was lot of snow there and rarely shaped mountains, and sea. Very cold basically. We had to drive carefully. We met a moose. It ate leaves. We visited
                    farm with lamas and feed them.     </br>
                    There was a sauna and beach  near our place and actually it was a good place to spot Aurora.  We have seen usualy just week dispersed aurora, cause it was cloudy.
                    One night there had been nice stripes and dancing aurora.
                    many years ago.                   </br>
                    I was then also in Alta and have seen very weak aurora with little stripes there and there. There was a full moon in Alta then and very cloudy. </b>
                    And finally in Tromsø I was there  with then my boyfriend,  we have seen medium strong aurora shaped as curtains and stripes over mountains.
                    One have to hunt the best place to see Aurora and often drive outside the city to the dark places without clouds. We saw arcs and curtains of green aurora moving away from us and fading.

                    Ibsen's Peer Gynt climbed Gjendineggen, now called Bessegen, with a reindeer bull. Yes, you can really be close to reindeers there, but they are shy, not going towards you.

              Bryggen, the old wharf of Bergen, is a reminder of the town’s importance as part of the Hanseatic League’s trading empire from the 14th to the mid-16th century.
               Many fires, the last in 1955, have ravaged the characteristic wooden houses of Bryggen. Its rebuilding has traditionally followed 
              old patterns and methods, thus leaving its main structure preserved, which is a relic of an ancient wooden urban structure once common in Northern Europe.

            Røros Mining Town and the Circumference is linked to the copper mines, established in the 17th century and exploited for 333 years until 1977. 
            The site comprises the Town and its industrial-rural cultural landscapes; Femundshytta, a smelter with its associated area; and the Winter Transport Route. 
            Completely rebuilt after its destruction by Swedish troops in 1679, Røros contains about 2000 wooden one- and two-storey houses and a smelting house.
             Many of these buildings have preserved their blackened wooden façades, giving the town a medieval appearance. Surrounded by a buffer zone, coincident with the area of privileges (the Circumference) 
            granted to the mining enterprise by the Danish-Norwegian Crown (1646), the property illustrates the establishment and 
            flourishing of a lasting culture based on copper mining in a remote region with a harsh climate.

          A cluster of islands centered on Vega, just south of the Arctic Circle, forms a cultural landscape of 103,710 ha, of which 6,930 ha is land. The islands bear testimony to a distinctive frugal way of life, 
          based on fishing and harvesting down from the eider ducks over the past 1,500 years.
           Fishing villages, quays, warehouses, eider houses (built for eider ducks to nest in), 
           farming landscapes, lighthouses and beacons are important sites. Evidence is also found of human settlement from the Stone Age onwards.
            By the 9th century, the islands had become an important centre for the supply of down, which appears to have accounted for around a third of the islanders’ income.

              The Struve Arc is a chain of survey triangulations stretching from Hammerfest in Norway to the Black Sea, through 10 countries and over 2,820 km. These are points of a survey, 
              carried out between 1816 and 1855 by the astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve, which represented the first accurate measuring of a long segment of a meridian. 
              This helped to establish the exact size and shape of the planet and marked an important step in the development of earth sciences and topographic mapping. 
              It is an extraordinary example of collaboration among scientists from different countries, and of collaboration between monarchs for a scientific cause. 
              The original arc consisted of 258 main triangles with 265 main station points.

           The Naeroyfjord the most beautiful and wildest arm of the Sognefjord is on the UNESCO World Heritage list.
            Fjord cruises in unique setting, with sheer, snow-topped mountains, waterfalls and idyllic farms clinging to the mountainsides. 
            The Nærøyfjord is 17 km long and the narrowest point is only 250 m wide. The passage through Nærøyfjord is one of the most dramatic fjord trips in Europe.
             A passenger boat between Gudvangen-Aurland-Flåm is running all year.

           The Geiranger Fjord is a fjord in the Sunnmøre region of Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. 
           It is located entirely in the Stranda Municipality. It is a 15-kilometre -long branch off the Sunnylvsfjorden, which is a branch off the Storfjorden.
           The fjord is 260 metres deep while the surrounding mountains are 1600-1700 metres high. 
           The fjord is also known for its spectacular waterfalls and deserted fjord farms high up on the steep cliffsides. 
           The now deserted fjord farms tell the tales of a different time and way of life. 
           The idyllic nature and the dramatic mountains will impress any visitor in the area.

            Located in a dramatic landscape of mountains, waterfalls and river valleys, the site comprises hydroelectric power plants, transmission lines, factories, 
            transport systems and towns. The complex was established by the Norsk-Hydro Company to manufacture artificial fertilizer from nitrogen in the air. 
            It was built to meet the Western world’s growing demand for agricultural production in the early 20th century. The company towns of Rjukan and Notodden show workers’ accommodation 
            and social institutions linked by rail and ferry to ports where the fertilizer was loaded. 
            The Rjukan-Notodden site manifests an exceptional combination of industrial assets and themes associated to the natural landscape. It stands out as an example of a new global industry in the early 20th century.

      </div>
          </br>
        
        <p>Aurora Borealis are these green and sometimes other colors on the night sky caused by lot of charged particles entering our atmosphere. It can be seen in the north part of the globe near polar circle, while near the south polar circle this light phenomenon is called Aurora Australis.</p>
        <p>This is how is happened: Sun is continuously streaming particles called solar wind. These particles (plasma: electrons, protons, ions) fly in space and interacts with magnetic fields of planets.
Earth's magnetosphere is pretty much deformed by the solar wind. Towards the sun magnetosphere is squeezed to ca. 65 000 km and on the night sun is extended up tu  ca. 6 300 000 km (!!!), all this is done by the huge pressure of sun particles.
This magnetic field lines deviations to the sides allow make lower charge density at the poles, let's call it a funnel, and charged particles are drowned down this funnel by the voltage difference.
   </p>
        <p>
Aurora are in fact caused by particles which were drawn to the elongated night side of magnetosphere and then are they drawned back to the polar funnels by the electric potential difference between magnetic poles and magnetic fields on the night tail, while locally are drived electrons by the magnetic force.
</p>
          </br></br>
        <p>
                <center> <img src="./assets/img/geomagnetic_field.jpg" width="620" height="320">  </center>
         </p>
   
        </br></br>
<p>
Sun is rotating every 27 days, and intensity and speed of solar wind is changing. Thus also Earth's magnetosphere has a time to relax, when comes slower particles with lower mass. These lower energy particles are deflected from the Earth by Van Allen Belts.
  </p>
<p>
As charged particles enter the atmosphere, they are spinning down the Earth's magnetic lines. Particles interact with atoms and molecules, and excited molecules and atoms interact between themselves, and sometimes there are also ionised and those emitting electrons can ionise nearby atoms, or sometimes, when they have enough kinetic energy they can fly along magnetic lines out of the atmosphere.
 </p>
 <p>
The aurora color is due to the emitted light from exited atoms in the ionophere. Green (557.7 nm) and red (630 nm) aurora is from oxygen atoms in ionosphere.
These emission are longer than usual (0.7 s for green and 107 s for red respectively) because of both transitions are forbidden in oxygen atoms. Since all particle transitions should "most probably" obey quatum mehanics seletion rules, these forbidden transitions
are though just very less probable and change in symmetries take longer times.
 </p>
 <p>
When Aurora reaches the lower layers of atmosphere, which is very uncommon, molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen take over in producing visible light emission, radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum, with 428 nm (blue) being dominant. Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the "curtains", show up at the highest levels of solar activity. The molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones because they are not forbidden by quatum mechanics laws of numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
Aurora and particles from space in our atmosphere are studied in Norway. They think about the connection of aurora chemistry with the deplation of ozone in the atmosphere and therefore <a href="https://www.unis.no/pulsating-aurora-a-possible-threat-to-ozone/" color="white">enhancing global warming </a></p>
